# Watch My Movies

A simple app to share your favourite movies with your friends and keep a track of it so you never forget the experience!

# Demo

The demo of this app is live and is hosted on [movies.noorudd.in](https://movies.noorudd.in).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- `NextJS`
- `ReactJS`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `TypeScript`

## üì¶ Libraries & Why I am using it?

- `Zustand: For state management`
- `Axios: To handle API calls`
- `React Hot Toast: To provide awesome UI notifications (like alerts)`
- `UUID: To generate unique IDs as keys`
- `OMDB & TMDB API: To fetch movies details and poster`

## üö¶ Running the project

To run the project in your local environment, follow the below steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace **API_URL** inside `.env` with your API URL. Alternatively, create a dummy JSON file and watch it in a local host and enter that localhost URL here.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` or `yarn start` to get the project started.
5. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the address shown in your console) in your web browser to view the app.

## üß† What New I Learnt?

- As I wanted to learn TypeScript and NextJS, so though what's better way to learn rather then creating project!
- How Zustand is a good alternative to Context API and how simple it is to use to manage small apllications.
- How to create Pagination or 'Load More' feature for unlimited scroll.
